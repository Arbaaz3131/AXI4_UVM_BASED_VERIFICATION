# AXI4_UVM_BASED_VERIFICATION

-> Worked on functional verification of the AXI4 protocol, focusing on its role in high-performance and high-bandwidth systems.

-> Built a UVM-based testbench for AXI4 with support for single master-slave communication, including burst, interleaving, and outstanding transactions.

-> Implemented a functional coverage model, and a self-checking slave environment to verify DUT functionality
